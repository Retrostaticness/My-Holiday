My Holiday
I went to Johor for 5 days. We went to Johor my parents had to fetch my sister there for her university enrollment. 
Soo... i was forced to go because no one will be at home :( 
And after leaving my sis at Johor, we went to Genting. I miss my Programming lesson that day because I was in a car otw back home... Sooo, sorry teachers, 
I feel guilty.

My Food 
We ate a lot of delicious food during our stay at Genting. We ate Madam Kwan's Nasi Bojari. Somehow "Bojari" sounds like No Fingers if
I translate it to my Hokkien and Malay.

My Desserts
We went to a dessert shop called "Mykori" which sells dessrts called "bingsu" which is bassically overpriced ice kacang that is absolutely worth it.
The ice in that "bingsu" just melts in your mouths, it's not the same as ice kacang because ice kacang has bigger chunks of ice.
